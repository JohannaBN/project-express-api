# Project Express API

This project entails creating a backend API using Express, adhering to RESTful principles. The API features multiple endpoints to retrieve either a collection of data or a single item.

## The problem

To fulfill the requirements, the project was approached by first setting up an Express server. Then, routes were defined to handle different types of requests, including retrieving collections and single items. Middleware like CORS was utilized for enhanced functionality and security.
